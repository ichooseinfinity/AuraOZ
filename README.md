# AuraOZ
Bits and pieces of information and designs on my journey of discovering how to duplicate myself in the virtual forms of Avatars and an Aura and then create a generalized pathway for other people to have the option of doing the same or similar. It's not in a coding language but I intend to put up enough information for it to make sense. Might take me a while.
